### 👋 Hey there! I'm Darshil Bhakhar

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** who started his coding journey the fun way, by trying to make games! 🎮 Back in my academic days, I was fascinated by how games are made. That curiosity led me to build small games in **Unity**, which later evolved into a full-blown love for software development (some of those games are in my [portfolio](https://www.darshilbhakhar.com/projects), feel free to explore!).

### 🔧 What I Do
I specialize in crafting web applications that solve real-world problems with clean, maintainable code. I’ve worked across startups and enterprise-level environments, including a meaningful stint at **RBC**, where I contributed to fintech platforms like **PayEdge** and **Receivables**. My work often involves building full-stack solutions, integrating third-party APIs, and improving user experiences.

### 💡 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** PHP (Laravel), C++, Python, Java (Spring Boot), MySQL  
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Azure, GitHub Actions, Splunk, Dynatrace  

### 🎯 What Drives Me
- Solving real problems through practical software solutions 🛠️  
- Creating smooth user experiences that customers actually enjoy 💬  
- Debugging (yes, even the weird edge cases) 🔍  
- Building games for fun and learning 🎲  

### 🚀 My Journey
From experimenting with Unity as a student to building real applications like E-commerce,food ordering systems, healthcare system and fintech tools, I’ve always been driven by a desire to **make tech useful and enjoyable**. I enjoy mentoring, collaborating, and turning business challenges into intuitive, scalable software.
